This project was created to explore Graham algorithm.

### Covex hull

*Realisation is based on vector like class Array and Graham algorithm. As sorting is used Quicksort with pivot index in the middle of the part of the list.*

* available working with any (with integer coordinates) points array
* exception if accessing to the array out of its range
* after making from initial array the array of points in convex hull available area calculation

**Input:**

Commands number M (1 ≤ M ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5). Then M rows of commands one by one.

**Output:**

Result of each command.
